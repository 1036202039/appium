## Code of Conduct


### Purpose

Appium is a piece of technology, but **the core of the Appium community is the people in it**. Our primary goal is ensure this community is as inclusive to the largest number of people with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof), or other marginalized aspect of comunity members.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We expect all members of the Appium community, including paid and unpaid agents, administrators, and users, to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all Appium community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to the Appium community.


### Appium Community Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase community citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.


### Friendly Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is rarely a single right answer. A difference of technological preferences is not a license to be rude.

Expected behavior:

  * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
  * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  * Don't make assumptions about a person's background, abilities, or intentions.
  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassing other users of Appium is never tolerated, whether via public or private media. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

  * Verbal or written comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and religion (or lack thereof).
  * Use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language.
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following.
  * Harassing photography or recording.
  * Sustained disruption of discussion threads, issues, talks or other events.
  * Inappropriate physical contact.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Microaggressive behaviors. Microaggressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial or sexual slights and insults. We consider microaggressions to be a form of harassment, and we will take appropriate action for incidences of microagressions.


### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event). Individuals who have been banned are not allowed to participate in online discussions on [appium.io](https://discuss.appium.io/) and in the [Appium github organization](https://github.com/appium). In addition, they will not be allowed to attend any events organized by the Appium team.


### If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Full contact information is listed in the [Contact Info](#contact-info) section of this document. All communications will be kept strictly confidential, unless otherwise required by law. No issue will be considered too inconsequential or unimportant.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.


### Governing Policy and Addressing Grievances

If you receive a temporary or permanent ban, your name will be added to a private ban list. If you receive a temporary ban, you will be notified via private message once the ban has been lifted and you are allowed to rejoin the community.

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify us with a concise description of your grievance at the email address listed under [Contact Info](#contact-info). Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our governing policies.
